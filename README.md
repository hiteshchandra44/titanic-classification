# titanic-classification
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Predictor, a machine learning project that utilizes historical data from the infamous Titanic disaster to predict whether a person would have survived based on their age and sex. This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for building a classification model to determine the likelihood of survival during the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

Key Features:

Dataset: Explore the comprehensive dataset containing information on passengers, including age, sex, and survival status. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the predictive model.

Machine Learning Model: Dive into the core of the project, where a classification model is implemented to analyze patterns and relationships between age, sex, and survival outcomes. The model is trained to make predictions on new data, helping to understand the factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

Jupyter Notebooks: Find detailed Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. These notebooks provide transparency into the decision-making process and serve as valuable educational resources.

Codebase: Access the Python code responsible for building, training, and testing the machine learning model. Contributors can collaborate to enhance the model's accuracy and explore additional features for a more comprehensive analysis.

Documentation: Gain insights into the methodology, assumptions, and limitations of the model through comprehensive documentation. This resource is valuable for understanding the nuances of the Titanic Survival Predictor and for contributing to its improvement.

How to Contribute:

Contributions to the Titanic Survival Predictor project are encouraged! Whether you're interested in refining the model, exploring additional features, or enhancing documentation, your input is welcome.
